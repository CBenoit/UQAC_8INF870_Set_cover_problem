# 8INF870 - Set Cover Problem

This repository contains everything produced for our project of algorithm (lecture 8INF870, UQAC) on the Set Cover Problem (SCP).

There are four folders:

- `solver`: contains all the code of our SCP solver. There is a `CMakeLists.txt` file to build using _CMake_, but _VS2017_ configuration scripts are also provided in `solver/ide/` folder.
- `nomad`: [NOMAD](https://www.gerad.ca/nomad/) configurations and scripts to optimize parameters of our approached methods.
- `rapport_intermediaire`: midterm report latex sources (french).
- `rapport_final`: final report latex sources (french).
